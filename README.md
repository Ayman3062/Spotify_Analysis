## 🎧 Spotify_Analysis

A data-analysis project that explores music data (from Spotify / public datasets) to generate insights on song/artist/genre popularity, audio features, and music trends. Built primarily using Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib/seaborn) and aimed at demonstrating exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation.

## ✅ Project Overview

The project uses a dataset of Spotify music metadata and audio features.

It performs cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful patterns and insights.

The goal is to answer questions such as:

Which songs / artists / genres are most popular?

What audio features (tempo, energy, loudness, danceability, etc.) correlate with popularity?

How have song characteristics changed over time (e.g. duration, loudness)?

What distinguishes top songs from less popular ones, based on features and metadata?
## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Data libraries: pandas, NumPy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

## 🔍 Analysis & Insights (What this project does)

Data cleaning and preprocessing: handling missing values, duplicates, correct data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): distributions of popularity, audio features, tempo, loudness, etc.

Correlation and trend analysis:

Relationship between popularity and audio features (energy, danceability, loudness)

Evolution of song duration or other features over years or genres

Genre / Artist / Year-wise comparisons: which genres or artists dominate popularity; genre-wise feature patterns

Visualization: histograms, scatter plots, box plots, trend lines — to communicate insights effectively

## ⭐ What You’ll Gain / Why This Project Matters

Experience with real-world data cleaning and EDA workflows (often messy data, missing values, categorical + numeric mixtures)

Skills in data-driven musical analytics — understanding what makes a song popular or how musical tastes / attributes evolve over time

A strong project for your GitHub / portfolio — combining data analysis with music domain insights (good for data-science / analytics / BI roles)

Foundation for future extensions: you could add dashboards (with Power BI / Tableau), build a web front-end, or integrate recommendation logic
(Optional) Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

(Optional) CSV/JSON datasets containing Spotify song metadata & audio features
